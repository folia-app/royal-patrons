# Royal Patrons ðŸ‘‘

This is a CLI application that helps in collecting addresses of NFT patrons who've paid royalties.  
It was created to collect addresses for an allowlist using https://lanyard.org as part of the launch of https://viper.folia.app.

## Installation

To install the application you can `npm` or `yarn` as follows:

```bash
yarn global add royal-patrons
# or
npm install -g royal-patrons
```

If you'd like to install from source, clone the repo and run install:
  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:folia-app/royal-patrons.git
cd royal-patrons
yarn
# or
npm install
```

## Usage

Make sure that you've added `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` to an `.env` with your Etherscan API key or passed the Etherscan API key via the `--etherscanAPI` flag.  
You can get one from https://etherscan.io/myapikey.

To run the program use the `run` command with the list of NFT contract addresses to track and list of royalty recipient addresses.  
You could alternatively provide a filepath containing them as comma separated values.
```bash
$ royal-patrons run -h
Usage: royal-patrons run [options] <contractAddresses> <recipientAddresses>
